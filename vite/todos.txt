(1 - 5) Importance

------------------------------------------------ TODO ------------------------------------------------
Levels:
	- Maybe add a level system.

Shop:
	- Allow users to buy in game currency.
	- In the shop page, there are multiple tags and price ranges.
	- Using stripe, handle user purchases. These interactions should be sort of a "one time" purchase. 
	  So we're not storing any of the user's information for safety reasons.
	- Users should see how much money they have in the lobby, and in game.

(maybe) Add pressing, instead of dragging and dropping

(maybe) Have users throw the dices one by one, to determine who starts first.

(maybe) Have multiple rotations and angles to play the game with (Inside settings in-game)

(maybe) Move the reset and lock orbit controls into settings.

(maybe) Add an undo button?

(3) Add other auth methods. Have the users enter a username after they successfully register with a provider.
Also maybe show them the picture that we will use, and alow them to change it.

(2) Add a "share with your friends" button.

(3) Add voices for each in-game message :)

(3) Add password reset.

(3) Add ability to change user information like pfp, username, email, password, inside the profile page.

------------------------------------------------ IDEAS ------------------------------------------------
--- Description of what I want to build ---
I want the user to be able to create a room, share it and be able to play with a single other person.
I want the user to be able to play with random people from all around the world.
I want the user to be able to do pass-and-play, where there are two physical users using one computer, against each other.
Each user can have a friends-list, where they can add or remove friends, see their online status, and be able to send them a match request.
The interface, i thought, should be like a big card in the middle, with a glossy background to it. Users should have the option to view
their friends-list, start a game with a random, or start a pass-and-play game. They should also see a profile icon, where they can view their
profile.

--- Some ideas for the lobby layout ---
Have the board closed up in the background doing an animation, maybe spinning or just floating. Maybe have
the dice just float around it, or do some kind of an up down animation, with a flip in the middle. The 
general background could be a nice cozy and warm background. Maybe a fireplace, or a jungle or a woody
background.

1: Have like a general mild dark overlay over the background, with buttons to login/logout/signup in the top
and other buttons to play in the bottom area. If the user is logged in, then they'll see their logo on the
top right. They can see their friends list right at the bottom of it. 
	
2: Same structure as 1, but moved inside a semi-small card with a glassy background. Maybe the animation in the 
back could be moved to the left of the screen and the card to the right?

3: Same buttons structure as 1, but without the animations. The board will be like the background of a card,
that will contain all the buttons. There will be no animation of the board in this case.

	- have a button to stop the board animation.
	- The opponent can be anonymous or already a user

--- How we will make dough! ---
Have a shop that will allow users to buy our in game currency. Then they will be able to buy skins? for things like the 
board, checkers, the dice, and enable more env maps. They will also be able to gamble in games against their friends, or randoms.
There will be tournaments of like 16 people, and to join it you will need to put some amount of money on the line. 
Users should be able to up the stakes in game, by using the special dice??
Maybe there should be a subscription premium for users. Users will pay monthly for the service, and get features like, no ads and some skins.
There should be some level of advertisements for non-premium users.
